# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)

I like activities like this. When I am really struggling with complex programming problems I do this exact thing. Being
able to write out in English what I need the program to do and breaking it down into components really helps to
reduce the complexity. It also makes it easier to keep track of what I have and have not done yet.

I am really hoping to gain confidence with using APIs to make powerful web apps. I have mostly done front-end programming
and being able to use data in the backend will be extremely helpful. I am also a bit rusty on my python so I am hoping
to gain some confidence in the language.
